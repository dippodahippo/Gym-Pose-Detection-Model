# Gym-Pose-Detection-Model

## This created model was made for an Engineering Clinics project, by me, Diptorshi Tripathi, at VIT-AP University. It is a model made with CNN using 4 CNN and 3 Dense layers, over 100 stages, and yielded a 93.4% accuracy. It was trained on a dataset of 3360 images (all collected by our team, not for public use) and then augmented.
